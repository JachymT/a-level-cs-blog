# Abstraction
Abstraction means removing detail to simplify something complex, untill only necessary details for the problem remain.

## The nature of Abstraction
Abstraction is both a problem solving aproach and a computational technique.

It is the process of removing unnecessary details so that what you are left with are key features of a model, only showing those details which are relevant to understanding how to use and interact with the model.

### Types of abstraction
- Representational abstraction - simplifying a problem down to what you need
- Abstraction by generalisation - grouping together similarities to categorise a problem, this is useful for finding pre-existing solutions
- Data abstraction - details about how data is being stored are hidden, used in data structures like stacks and queues.

### Levels of Abstraction
Problems often make use of levels of abstraction. This just means that the user interactacts with **high levels** of abstraction and the code is abstracted at a **low level** in oder to do complex tasks.

## The need for abstraction
For non-experts to use and interact with a model and for efficient design during software development. Consider who's going to use it and how.

### Examples of abstraction
- For example a flight simulation game, only uses variables that are needed for the plane to fly and doesnt use variables that affect how the plane works, such as its colour and capacity, or the exact layour of buttons. 
- Flowcharts are an example of abstracted program code. 
- Variables are abstracted away by using names for memeory loactions. 
- Object-oriented programming abstracts real world entities and thier functionality and characteristics
- Networking and the TCP/IP model. They are mde simpler to understand and seperated and provide a clear path for information to travel. The protocols mean each layer can be hidden from the others.
