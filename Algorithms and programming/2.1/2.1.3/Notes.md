# Thinking procedurally
Thinking procedurally makes writing programs easier by problem decomposition making it easier to design and partition. A large and complex problem is broken down in smaller, underlying subproblems that need to be solved.

## Top-down design
Known as **stepwise refinement**, tasks are split into smaller tasks, in a modular structure. Higher up levels provide an overview while lower down levels specify details about the program. Ideally each subroutine at the bottom is self-contained and independent.

## Advantages
- Independent modules can be tested seperately
