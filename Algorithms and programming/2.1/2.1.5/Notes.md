# Thinking Concurrently
Multitasking is a systems when the illusion is given to simultaneously execute multiple tasks at once by swithcing porcesess in and out the processor. **Concurrent processing** the the name given to multitasking on multi core systems. Multiple cores working on multiple tasks at once improves overall performance. This is used when multiple applications are running and each one can be executed independently. Similar to what the OS does - concurrent tasks do not require inputs to feed into each other.

### Advantages
- More efficient use of processor time - idle time is reduced
- Fewer bottlenecks - processes in the blocked state can give way to processes being executed simultaneuosly
- Multithreading is more efficient for linked tasks that needs lots of components calculated without having to wait for each one to finish individually

### Disadvantages
- Processes competing for recourses have to wait.
