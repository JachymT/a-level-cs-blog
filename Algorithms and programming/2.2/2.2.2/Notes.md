# Computational Methods
For solving problems of a computational nature. The problem must be:
- Solved within a finite amount of time
- Have inputs outputs and calculations 
- clearly defined
- considered if decomposition and abstraction are possible to apply
- considered what storage is needed and what data is being handled

## Visualisation
Visualistation can be any process that represents data or a problem, often in an illustrative way. Images and graphs help people solve complex tasks or understand models. For example drawing a diagram for an algorithm isntead of reading pseudocode.

Need to consider what form works best to avoid being innaccurate (e.g using MAT LAB for th), but it should still be simplistic and focus on the most important and clear data.

## Performance modelling
Performance modelling (testing) evaluating if a program's performance and uses that knowledge to improve it. Uses simmulations of mathematical models for testing to reduce costs. Done by creating criteria and complting tests on an application.

Provides a cheaper and easier method of testing, since it can be done before the final system is fully implemented (but also its done on the final test). 

Stress testing can be done to test ‘erroneous’ scenarios of the program.
