# Computational Methods
For solving problems of a computational nature. The problem must be:
- Solved within a finite amount of time
- Have inputs outputs and calculations 
- clearly defined
- considered if decomposition and abstraction are possible to apply
- considered what storage is needed and what data is being handled

## Visualisation
Visualistation can be any process that represents data or a problem, often in an illustrative way. Images and graphs help people solve complex tasks or understand models. For example drawing a diagram for an algorithm isntead of reading pseudocode.
