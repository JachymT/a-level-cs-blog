Subroutines (procudures and functions) are blocks of code that carry out a a set of named instructions. They are definded in psydocode code with: 

```py
procedure name(parameters)
  #code sequence
endprocedure

name(arguments)
```

a **function** diffferenciates from a procedure because it returns a value

**Advantages of Subroutues**
