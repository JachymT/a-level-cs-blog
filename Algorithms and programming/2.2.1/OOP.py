# Object Oriented Programming is a concept that more closely models the real world
# Attributes model characeristics of an object like we would use variables or data structures in structured programming
# Methods model behaviours of an object like we would use functions for in structured programming
# A class defines a blueprint for these attributes and methods
# Creating instances of a class can be done to create as many objects as needed - instantiation

# Crop simulation
