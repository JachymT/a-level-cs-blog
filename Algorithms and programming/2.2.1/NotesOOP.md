# Object Oriented Programming is a concept that more closely models the real world
# Attributes model characeristics of an object like we would use variables or data structures in structured programming
# Methods model behaviours of an object like we would use functions for in structured programming
# A class defines a blueprint for these attributes and methods
# Creating instances of a class can be done to create as many objects as needed - instantiation

# creating a class
# difference between public and private atributes
# private attributes are only know by themselves, and cannot be accesed directly outside the class, they can only be accessed within the class
# in python, private attributes are indicated by an underscore prefix
# This is just a practise and not a solution, _ is an indicator to the program since python cannot implement private attributes

# Encapsulation
# Hides the details of implementation from the user
# So the user doesnt need to know how the program works
# They can control the program via a user **interface**
# They cant access anything that is locked

# Interface - controlling an object in a predefined way
# Methods allow for interaction with the object

# Inheritance 
# allows to build on pre-existing work, which is advantageous 
# A child class inherics functionality and characteristics from a parent
