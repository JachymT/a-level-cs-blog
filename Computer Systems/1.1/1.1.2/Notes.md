# Types of Processors

## RISC 
Reduced instruction set computer - aim to use as simple instructions as possible to be executed within a single clock cycle.

The instructions are harder to translate since the compiler is doing more work and making more lines of code. More RAM is needed to store these instructions. However each instruction requires less **hardware**, **processing power**, and **energy**, meaning they executed quickly. In this Architecture more room is left for registers and cache.

Since instructions are uniform in execution time, pipelinning becomes feesable.

90% of proccessors work off of RISC

## CISC
Complex instructuion set computer - aims to complete a task in as few instructions as a possible, making use of very complex instructions. The instructions are easy to translate from a high level language to assembly, but take more clock cycles to execute.

They still appear in some desktop computers and laptops but utilize RISC practises and microcodes, since RISC proccesors are more benefical.
