Takes images of shapes on a piece of paper and warps those shapes until OCR recognises that shape as a character on a database. Therefore it can take scanned documents and convert them to editable text files. Since pattern matching is a complicated process, OCR can make mistakes, but it is still faster than typing a document up by hand.
