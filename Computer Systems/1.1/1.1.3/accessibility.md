# Accessibility Inputs and Output Devices

## Speech synthesisers
An output made to help people who have trouble reading. Blind people can use software to read text of documents in multiple langues and voices. For example some screen reader software include Windows narrator.

## Speech recognition
Provides an alternative to typing on a keyboard, and can be used to type or control certain programs. Some also have commands to inciate them or format text and send it. Speech recogintion software is an input that helps disabled people manage limb disorders or those with dyslexia. Algorithms are used to analyse sound waves and find the most probable fit, making speech recognition unreliable at times.

## Augmentative and alternative communication
Using speech synthesisers, these techniques can supliment speaking and writing for those with speach and langauge imparements. External devices can be used to take a range of inputs (gestures, pictures, eye trackers, mice, typing) and use speech generating devices to output text for the user.

## Eye-tracking software
Follows the movements of the the eye to navigate a computer screen. Through calculations and infrared light reflected of the eye, its position is worked out on the screen.

## Anti glare and adjustable screens
Colour blind people and those with poor vision may have trouble reading text or interacting with screens. Screens with output setting to change light levels, contrast, typeface and font size can help overcome problems those with bad eye sight face and may stop thier eyes from being damaged. Magnification on software also helps for those with poor eye sight.

## Adaptive keyboards
For example an expanded keyboard. A larger and more robust keyboard made for heavy duty use, to help physically disabled and visually impaired users. It can be aranged into an easier layout or come with audio feedback. These specifically help for people who strugle with fine motor control. Smaller keyboards exist for people with finer but limited motor control.

## Puff-suck switch
Can be used as input devices instead of a mouse. Usefull for those with limited movement below the head. Suck or puff down the tube to activate a switch which conects to a software to act as an input in many ways. Puffing and sucking can move around the screen or scroll through selections.

## Foot mouse
Can be used as input devices instead of a mouse. Usefull for those with limited movement above the legs. Using one foot as a mouse and one as buttons bound to shortcuts works similarly to a typical keyboard.

## Predictive text
Software that predicts the most likely word you will type, so users dont have to type entire words after a few key strokes, which reduces physical effort and increases input speed.
