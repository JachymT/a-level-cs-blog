## Cache
Cache is CPU's on board memory, where some. It the **closest and fastest** memory for storing instructions, which are copied over from RAM. Less frequently used instructions in cache are replaced with more commenly fetched ones. The CPU checks for cache before checking RAM.

Faster and more cache increase the CPU's performance since instructions are being stories. There are restrictions on Cache usage however and most modern processor have 128KB to 8MB of Cache memory, which is divided into levels. Cache is effient when it is fast to fetch from so a large cache would be detrimental. Levels of Cache help further maximise efficiny, level 1 is closest to the CPU and smallest, going up to level 3 where they get larger and take longer to fetch from.

Cache is also much more expensive than other memory.
