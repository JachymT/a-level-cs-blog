# Software

## Software types

### System software
Runs the computer system, provides an interface, controls hardware and peripherals.
Includes Operating systems like Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and device drivers.

### Utility software
Designed to analyze, configure and optimize a computer system.
Includes disk defragmentation, antivirus software and file manager.

### Application software
A consumer product, a software made to be distributed to many consumers.
Includes word, powerpoint, firefox.

### Custom (bespoke) software
A software designed specificaly for one user, or a company to meet all thier custom needs, more expensive than using application software.
Includes company web portals, food chain software for thier employees, netflix software for creators.

## Operating system purposes
Operating systems perform many different tasks at the base level of the computer and create an API for software to be developed on. Without them there is no access to the computer's recoures and nothing to manage them. They serve the following functions to create a platform between te user and the 

### Managing Peripherals
All hardware needs to comunicate with the computer and it cannot do this without a device driver. Inputs and outputs are translated by the driver so that the OS can control it. For example keyboards and mice need to give inputs to the computer and have custom settings to do so.

### Utility programs
Background and active helper programs that run on the software. Some utilities are key, and are loaded right away. Examples of Utility programs are:
- Disk Defragmentation
- File management
- encryption
- file compression
- installers
- system moniter

### Memory and file management
Alocates space for programs and makes sure the OS Kernal is loaded - the kernal makes sure memory and file management is executed correctly. Its key processes are:

- **Segmentation** - spliting up mememory into logical chunks of varying size, used by a program for assigning sections and processes and splitting it up.
- **Paging** - spliting up programs into equally sized sections so they can be moved between main memory and RAM.
- Assigning **virtual memory**
- Moving files to and from secondary storage.
- Loading programs these program segments or pages into RAM when they are needed.

### Paging


### Processor management
Multitasking (insert citation) and control how processor time is divided. Programs need to run in the right order and often simultaneously. It also handles interupts ( insert citation).

### Security
Firewall inplementation - software that stops harmful incoming trafic and scans for outside programs trying to get access to the system.
User management - provides levels of access and a profiles for users on the Network.

### User interface
Provides a visual platform for users to interact with. A UI can be as simple or a terminal, but can also be a fully customised screen with pointers, windows, menus and icons. 

### Networking
Interfacing to other computers with WiFi and cables.
