# Software methodologies
There are 5 main approaches when working on a software development project. The lifecycle of software development can be partitioned into phases, which together lead to a well thought out, functional and maintained solution.

## Waterfall Method
Involves cascading from one stage in development to another, where each stage is clearly seperated and identifyable. In some cases going back to the previous stage can happen when re-assesing and re-working a project.

## Rapid Application Development
Building prototypes of the software after another untill a final product is reached. This method very effectively utilizes user feedback to iterate improvements and each prototype can be tested heavily and imporovements suggested.

## The Spiral Method
A risk driven model or guide to software development which works by adapting and generating a path to solve a project based on its risks. It ussualy starts with determining objectives then identifying and resolving risks, then developing and testing, then planning the next iteration in the spiral.

## Agile methodologies
A group of methodologies steming from RAD. They focus of achieving goals with iterative development as to solve the problem of ideas changing during development. These methods are refined by spliting iteration into sprints, which are short periods of time decicating to focusing on one small goal.

## Extreme Programming
A framework for producing high quality code and encourage developer statisfaction, in particular: simplicity, communication, feedback, courage and respect. It is an agile framework, so small regular software releases are expected. Team work and equality are valued.

## Choosing the right methodology 
The main aim is to choice a methodogoly to fit the software and the team.

### Building a website for a shop
If a template or clear desired webpage is established in early planning stages, the waterfall or RAD method would be best suited, because the goals are relatively simple.

### Building an operating system
Since this task would require many team memebers, an organised and dedicated methodology like Extreme Programming or an Agile Methodology would be effective in the long term.

### Building a video game
For a game project a spiral or Agile iterative approach would be effective in constructing a game quickly, since it can be a very repetitive and rocky path to get to a release.

### Should you use Agile over Waterfall, a comparison
Waterfall has many limitations compared to Agile. Whilst waterfall priorities linear development and breaks projects down into phases, Agile comprises of sequences of iterations, that repeat phases over. This lead to more thourough development using Agile methods, leading to a better evaluted and resolved software. Waterfall may be considered faster for shorter tasks in some aspects, since there in less need for repeated phases, however agile has the advantage of breaking up a project into smaller peices, so that the entrity of the development or implementation does not have to be done at once. Using waterfall on a large scale project would be vitually unmanigable.
