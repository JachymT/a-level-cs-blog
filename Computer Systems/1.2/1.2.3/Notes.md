# Software methodologies
There are 5 main approaches when working on a software development project. The lifecycle of software development can be partitioned into phases, which together lead to a well thought out, functional and maintained solution.

### Waterfall Method
Involves cascading from one stage in development to another, where each stage is clearly seperated and identifyable. In some cases going back to the previous stage can happen when re-assesing and re-working a project.

Advantages
- Very simple and easy to understand
- Easy to manage the projects because of the rigidity of the model
- Saves time over the other methods
- effective for smaller projects

Disadvantages
- Not applicable to projects that demand continuous maintenance
- Cannot include clients feedback whilst on going
- no option to know the end result of the entire project

### Rapid Application Development
Building prototypes of the software after another untill a final product is reached. This method very effectively utilizes user feedback to iterate improvements and each prototype can be tested heavily and imporovements suggested.

Advantages
- accelerates the entire software development process
- active user participation in the development process

### The Spiral Method
A risk driven model or guide to software development which works by adapting and generating a path to solve a project based on its risks. It ussualy starts with determining objectives then identifying and resolving risks, then developing and testing, then planning the next iteration in the spiral.

Advantages
- high amount of risk analysis - determines success
- effective for large scale projects
- Development is fast
- aditional functionality can always be added

Disadvantages
- costly model
- not appropriate for low-risk projects
- may continue indefinitely and never finish

### Agile methodologies
A group of methodologies steming from RAD. They focus of achieving goals with iterative development as to solve the problem of ideas changing during development. These methods are refined by spliting iteration into sprints, which are short periods of time decicating to focusing on one small goal.

Advantages
- adaptive
- rapid, continuous delivery of software
- communication and constant feedback from customer representatives

Disadvantages
- requires educated decision making
- project can easily get taken off track if the customer representative is not clear what final outcome that they want

### Extreme Programming
A framework for producing high quality code and encourage developer statisfaction, in particular: simplicity, communication, feedback, courage and respect. It is an agile framework, so small regular software releases are expected. Team work and equality are valued.

Advantages
- allows greater flexibility within the modeling process
- saves time on delivery
- solve problems through discussions
- mostly much cheaper than other methods

Disadvantages
- can lack design ideas and focus on only code
- can lead to bugs due to lacking documentation and planning
- only as good as the team working on it
- start of the project doesnt have an estimate for the effort needed to finish

## Choosing the right methodology 
The main aim is to choice a methodogoly to fit the software and the team.

### Building a website for a shop
If a template or clear desired webpage is established in early planning stages, the waterfall or RAD method would be best suited, because the goals are relatively simple.

### Building an operating system
Since this task would require many team memebers, an organised and dedicated methodology like Extreme Programming or an Agile Methodology would be effective in the long term.

### Building a video game
For a game project a spiral or Agile iterative approach would be effective in constructing a game quickly, since it can be a very repetitive and rocky path to get to a release.

### Agile vs Waterfall
Waterfall has many limitations compared to Agile. Whilst waterfall priorities linear development and breaks projects down into phases, Agile comprises of sequences of iterations, that repeat phases over. This lead to more thourough development when using Agile methods, leading to a better evaluted and resolved software. Waterfall may be considered faster for shorter tasks in some aspects, since there is less need for repeated phases, however agile has the advantage of breaking up a project into smaller peices, so that the entrity of the development or implementation does not have to be done at once. The flexiblity of Agile means the development process is not limted to only going forward. Using waterfall on a large scale project would be virtually unmanigable.
