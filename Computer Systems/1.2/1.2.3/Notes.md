# Software methodologies
There are 5 main approaches when working on a software development project, also know as **Software Development Life Cycles**. The lifecycle of software development can be partitioned into phases, which together lead to a well thought out, functional and maintained solution.

### Waterfall Method
Involves cascading from one stage in development to another, where each stage is clearly seperated and identifyable. One stage is finished before the next is started and in some cases going back to the previous stage can happen when re-assesing and re-working a project. Aims to reduce changes requirements during development, goals are clearly stated from the start.

Advantages
- Linnear - Very simple and easy to understand
- Easy to manage the projects because of the rigidity of the model
- Timescales are easy to keep to - easy to know if you are ahead or behind
- Saves time over the other methods

Disadvantages
- Not applicable to projects that demand continuous maintenance
- Not many ways to backtrack to a previous stage
- There won't be a working portotype untll near the end of the project
- costly
- slow

For
- effective at any scale of project
- projecrts with a clear objective/ vision/ requirements
- for low risk projects

### The Spiral Method
A risk driven model which works by adapting and generating a path to solve a project based on its risks. It ussualy starts with determining objectives, then identifying and resolving risks, then developing and testing, then evaluating and planning the next iteration in the spiral.

One loop is an iteration and sections of the loop are phases.

Advantages
- high amount of risk analysis - determines success
- risks are spotted early
- effective for complicated, large scale projects
- Development is iterative and can is split up.
- aditional functionality can always be added

Disadvantages
- costly
- complex
- not appropriate for low-risk projects
- may continue indefinitely and never finish - end date is unknown

### Rapid Application Development
Building prototypes of the software after another untill a final product is reached. This method very effectively utilizes user feedback to iterate improvements and each prototype can be tested heavily and imporovements suggested. Comes after waterfall but before agile

Advantages
- each loop is short - allowing for projects to change to mathc new requirements or feedback 
- active user participation and feedback in the development process
- moldable and easily changeable requirements
- focus on functionality not code quality

Dissadvantages
- less applicable and managable with a large scale team, and developers must all be highly skilled?
- requires lots of communicataion, and ideally a locally based team.
- focus on functionality not code quality

For
- interactive systems
- initial requirements do not need to be know

### Agile methodologies
A group of methodologies succeeding RAD. They focus on achieving goals with iterative development as to solve the problem of ideas changing during development. These methods are refined by spliting iterations into sprints, which are short periods of time dedicated to focusing on one small goal. These are repeated, each time focusisng on another part of the project untill the final product is made. Is often paired with extreme programing ideas.

Advantages
- adaptive and non linnear, stages don't have to be well defined
- rapid, continuous delivery of software
- communication and constant feedback from customer representatives
- focus on quality of code

Disadvantages
- requires educated decision making
- project can easily get taken off track if the customer representative is not clear as to what final outcome that they want.

### Extreme Programming
A framework for producing high quality code and encourage developer statisfaction, in particular: simplicity, communication, feedback, courage and respect. It is an agile framework, so small regular software releases are expected. Team work and equality are valued.

Advantages
- saves time on delivery
- solve problems through discussions
- leads to happier and more productive teams

Disadvantages
- can lack design ideas and focus on only code
- can lead to bugs due to lacking documentation and planning
- only as good as the team working on it
- start of the project doesnt have an estimate for the effort needed to finish

## Choosing the right methodology 
The main aim is to choice a methodogoly to fit the software and the team.

### Building a website for a shop
If a template or clear desired webpage is established in early planning stages, the waterfall or RAD method would be best suited, because the goals are relatively simple.

### Building an operating system
Since this task would require many team memebers, an organised and dedicated methodology like Extreme Programming or an Agile Methodology would be effective in the long term.

### Building a video game
For a game project a spiral or Agile iterative approach would be effective in constructing a game quickly, since it can be a very repetitive and rocky path to get to a release.

### Agile vs Waterfall
Waterfall has many limitations compared to Agile. Whilst waterfall priorities linear development and breaks projects down into phases, Agile comprises of sequences of iterations, that repeat phases over. This lead to more thourough development when using Agile methods, leading to a better evaluted and resolved software. Waterfall may be considered faster for shorter tasks in some aspects, since there is less need for repeated phases, however agile has the advantage of breaking up a project into smaller peices, so that the entrity of the development or implementation does not have to be done at once. The flexiblity of Agile means the development process is not limted to only going forward. Using waterfall on a large scale project would be virtually unmanigable.
