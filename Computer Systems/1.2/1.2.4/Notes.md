#  Types of Programming Languages
Languages are classified into programming paradigms based on how they aproach problem solving.

Imperitive - Programmer instructs the machine on exactly what actions to perform

Declerative - Programmer declares the desired result and not the instructions on how to get to it. The language decides how to reach the outcome and how abstracted the process is.

## Procedural
Procedural langauges are common and apply to a wide range of problems. Easy to **implement** and **interpret**. Sequences of instructions are executed line by line. The key features of **structured procedural programming** are: sequence, selection, iteration and recursion.

## Object Oriented

### Comparing OOP and procedural programming paradigms in development

## Function
Use the concept of calling functions multiple times, and only using functions to get an output from an input. Mostly used to handle giant data sets. An example is Haskell.

## Logic
Use queries to solve problems after defining a set of rules. An example is Prolog.

## Assembly language
Assembly language is a programming language that uses meumonics to comunicate with the CPU. It is a low level language that can be converted into machine code 

For example if you wanted to load instruction 4 you might write LDA 0100. It is a simplified view of Machine code, which is more understandable for people. An instruction contains an opcode and operand part, which is split in the CIR. Below is the little man instruction set which needs to be learnt.

## Machine code instructions
Binary instructions that the CPU can process, specific to the type of CPU. All programs are translated into machine code 

### Opcodes
The opcode specifies the type of instruction to be executed.

### Operands
The operand specifies the data or address to be processed.
