#  Types of Programming Languages
Languages are classified into programming paradigms based on how they aproach problem solving.

Imperitive - Programmer instructs the machine on exactly what actions to perform

Declerative - Programmer declares the desired result and not the instructions on how to get to it. The language decides how to reach the outcome and how abstracted the process is.

## Procedural
Procedural langauges are common and apply to a wide range of problems. Easy to **implement** and **interpret**. Sequences of instructions are executed line by line. The key features of **structured procedural programming** are: sequence, selection, iteration and recursion.

## Object Oriented

### Comparing OOP and procedural programming paradigms in development

## Assembly language
Assembly language is a programming language that used meumonics to comunicate with the CPU. For example if you wanted to load instruction 4 you might write LDA 0100. It is a simplified view of Machine code, which is more understandable for people. An instruction contains an opcode and operand part, which is split in the CIR.

## Machine code instructions
Binary instructions that are specific to each type of CPU. Programs need to be translated into machine code before the CPU can read them.
### Opcodes
The opcode specifies the type of instruction to be executed.

### Operands
The operand specifies the data or address to be processed.

## relationship between assembly language and machine code
Assembly language is simplified machine code. For example an instruction will be represented by its opcode and operand makeup.
