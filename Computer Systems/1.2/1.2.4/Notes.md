## Assembly language
Assembly language is a programming language that used meumonics to comunicate with the CPU. For example if you wanted to load instruction 4 you might write LDA 0100. It is a simplified view of Machine code, which is more understandable for people. An instruction contains an opcode and operand part, which is split in the CIR.

## Machine code instructions
Binary instructions that are specific to each type of CPU. Programs need to be translated into machine code before the CPU can read them.
### Opcodes
The opcode specifies the type of instruction to be executed.

### Operands
The operand specifies the data or address to be processed.

## relationship between assembly language and machine code
Assembly language is simplified machine code. For example an instruction will be represented by its opcode and operand makeup.
