# Networks
A network is any connection between two or more computers, and allows them to send data back and forth.

A LAN is over a small geographical area and a WAN is over a large geographical area or multiple locations.

## Topologies
**Physical topologies** - How the wires are connected

**Logical topologies** - How the data flows

### Bus Topology
Bus topology is litterally just a straight line. One cable, called the **backbone**, connects all the devices together.

### Star Topology

### Mesh Topology

## Hardware
Home networks ussually just put all of these into one device. Also A hub is just a faster switch. Fibreoptics / other cables exist

### Network Interface Card
Usually built into the motherboard, the NIC is needed for connecting to a network. Assigns a unique MAC address to the device

### Router
Allows for connection to other networks (the internet). Checks and moves packets

### Wireless Access Point
Allows Wi-Fi devices to connect to a wired network.

### Switch
Directs the flow of data in a Network, the centre of a network, and sends data to the individual devices.

### Cables
Fibre optic, Copper coaxel,

## Client-server
A network where terminals (clients) connect to a central server. The server typically has lots of recourses and processing power. Clients inciates communication with the server and the server waits for client requests.

**Advantages**
- Secure - data is stored in one location
- central backups can be carreid out
- data and recoures can be shared between clients

**Disadvantages**
- single point of failure 0 if the server fails then the terminals fail
- expensive to set up
- proffesionals required to maintain the server

## Peer to Peer
A network where computers are connected together and can act as both servers and clients, both providing and requesting data.

**Advantages**
- cheap
- easy to maintain
- not dependent on a central server
- recourses can be shared between computers

**Disadvantages**
- backups must be performed seperatly
- imposible to trace the origins of files
- poor security
- hard to locate resources
