# Compression, Encryption and Hashing

## Compression

## Encryption
Encryption is encoding data to make it harder to understand by anyone other than the intended recipient. When storing or sending **plain-text** (unscrambled) data it is encrypted into **cypher-text** and decrypted to be viewed again. Encryption keeps information secure and unreadable.

Both ways a key is used for the algorithm to work. In **symmetric** encryption the same key is used for encryption and decryption. The key needs to remain private and must be already know by the sender and receiver, or secretly cshared 

In asymmetric different keys are used, a private and a public key.
