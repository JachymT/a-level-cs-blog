**Database** - A table makes a structured and organised database with data

**Information** - data with context

**Field** - a column in a database

**Entity** - information about something or someone that is being stored

**Record** - a row holds data for the entity

So fields store 1 piece of data for an entity and all of an entities data is stored in 1 row

**Validation**  - checks if an input is sensible, valid or in the right format
For example data types, dropdown lists (combo boxes) or field sizes

**Input mask** - a string of characters that indicates which inputs are valid - a format they need to follow. 
These are used in table fields and forms.
