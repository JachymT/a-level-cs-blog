The act give the owner or creator the right to how the work is used, including copying, adapting and lending selling copies.

When you agree to a license the owner is letting you use the software as long as you agree to thier terms. These terms can be restritive or not. Free software means there are no restrictions placed on the software, it can be modified adn distributed. Open source software is usually free software. Proprietary software restricts the user.
