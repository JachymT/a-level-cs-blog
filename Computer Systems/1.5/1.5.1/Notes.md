# Computer Related Legislation
Application of these covered in 1.5.2

## Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988
Attempts to protect an individual's or organisation's work by applying copyright automatically to any origional work created. The act give the owner or creator the right to how the work is used, including copying, adapting and lending selling copies. The legislation applies to digital content such as literary, musical, artistic and other works. In 1992 it was updated to include software, enforced by software licenses. When you agree to a license the owner is letting you use the software as long as you agree to thier terms. These terms can be restritive or not. Free software means there are no restrictions placed on the software, it can be modified adn distributed. Open source software is usually free software. Proprietary software restricts the user.

Copyright expires after 25-70 years depending on the type of content. Alive owners of content can take legal action if someone breaches the act.

Whilst copyright applies to all work, patents apply to **intellectual property** (ideas). This includes brand names, product designs symbols and imagery, inventions, and other things you can think into existence. Trademarks apply to indications of a company (like logos). The World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) argues that intelectual property protection through laws for copyright, patents, trademarks and designs encourage competition and advancements in technology, and allows for profit from licensing, merchandising, sponsorships and other forms of revenue for buinesses.

## Data Protection Act 1998
Protects people rather the actual data. It give people the rights over thier personal data and regulate how organisations handle personal data. The Information Commissioners Office enforces the data protection act in the UK, reguates things independently, and gives legal advice. Consent is technically not necessary to store data. Updated in 2018.

- used fairly and lawfully
- used for a specific and limited purpose

- accurate and up to date
- not kept for longer than neccessary
- proccessed in line with your rights
- kept secure to prevent loss or damage
- not be transferred to a country or territory outside the European Economic Area that do not have adequate data protection

Data subject - the person identified by personal data - has the right to know about data being stored about them and the rights to
- be informed how that data is being used
- view, erase and update any data stored about them
- stop or restrict the processing of their data
- object to certain usage of thier data

Privacy - refers to the protection of someone's personal data

Cofindetiality - refers to preventing unauthorised access to data

## Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000
RIPA regulates surveillance and public investigation. Places limits on investigatory powers such as the government, the police, social media and ISPs. Updated to be the Investigatory Powers Act 2016. Since the orgional act many more organisation have been given rights to data. Arguably it is an invasion of privacy and is often misused.

Public bodies with enough authority can:
- Demand customer's data from the ISP without the informing the customer.
- Carry out mass survielence
- Demand that ISPs have equipment in place for surveillance
- Demand that encryption keys be handed over
- Intercept digital communications
- Interception warrent can be kept secert, even in court

TLDR ISPs must collect data and that data must be handed over to companies with a warrent for surveilance if requested.
