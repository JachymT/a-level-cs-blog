## Automation in the work force
Computers are used to increase efficiency in the work force, mainly in manufacturing and repetitive jobs like store cashiers, or factory work. Also contributes to the rise in online shopping / services.
- reduces labour costs, reducing product prices
- mostly replacing tedious and monotonous jobs
- contributes to structural unemployment
- leads to reduced income for people whose skills become less useful
- Luddite Fallacy - in the long term technology lead to more new jobs being created than jobs lost

## Automation in decision making
Automation in decision making means the application of alorithms to real life situations. The biggest example is probably in social media, where peoples interests and information is collected to feed them targeted ads. If any situations are not considered by the person designing the computer program, or comptuers are left to make their own rules, the equality and safety of people can be put in danger.
- Used in application processes, CCTV security systems and recruitment
- Algorithms inherently have biases, leading to decision making which discriminates, partucularly agaisnt already oppressed groups.
- Driveless cars need to make difficult decisions about the value of human life, and there needs to be accountability for those desicions

## AI
AI is beign invested it in at a faster rate than ever before because of its ability to replicate human learning. However, AI has some major pitfalls, which without understanding, can lead people into the trap of thinking it can replace human intelligence.
- Fundementally there is disconnect between any kind of emotions, intentions or wider context. In essence it is just copying and not thinking.
- For example, a person can apply past information to question where some data they are given is true, but an AI cannot.
- It can easily deceive, sounding confident when it knows very little.
  - This leads to missinformation being spread or people being convinved to do things the AI is making up.
- Requires an increadible amount of data
  - This data can be stolen, unavailiable or incomplete
  - Not to mention the potential copyright infringement, of using this data (copyright designs and patents act 1988)
- Requires an even geater amount of proccessing power,
  - which is increadibly harmful to the planet, wasting heat and using fossil fuels
  - and also is limited by the hardware the creator has access to
- Cognitive biases that people have can appear in AI too

When AI is explainable - developed in a way that lets you see how an AI comes to the decision it makes, it can be hugely beneficial, and can be used collaborativly with people.

AI is used in:
  - Medical research
  - Every day use - chat bots, spellcheck
  - voice recognision
  - pretty much anything

## Environmental Effects
The more widly accessible technology is, the more it is produced and the more waste that gets thrown out. EU charging cabel laws is the best case study for this section.
